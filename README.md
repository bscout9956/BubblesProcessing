# BubblesProcessing
This project is a partial recreation of the Bubbles Screensaver made by Microsoft for Windows Vista+ in Processing (Python)
There is also a separate branch for the Java version. I decided not to make another repo since there is no need to.

# Issues

It lacks the collision detection that the original code has.
I couldn't overlay an image of a bubble (and tint it) without having an absurd impact on performance or compiler crashes.

# Misc

Feel free to pull request anything interesting to the code, I will be glad to see fixes or improvements to it.
