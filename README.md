# BubblesProcessing
This project is a terrible recreation of the Bubbles Screensaver made by Microsoft for Windows Vista+ in Processing (Java)

# Issues

It lacks the collision detection that the original code has.

# Misc

Feel free to pull request anything interesting to the code, I will be glad to see fixes or improvements to it.
