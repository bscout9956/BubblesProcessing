# BubblesProcessing
This project is a terrible recreation of the Bubbles Screensaver made by Microsoft for Windows Vista+

# Issues

It lacks the collision detection that the original code has. 
I couldn't get to actually overlay an image of a bubble (and tint it) without having an absurd impact on performance or compiler crashes.

# Misc

Feel free to pull request anything interesting to this piece of wonderful code, I will be glad to see fixes or improvements to my sloppy >> beginner << code
